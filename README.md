Once installed, go to Preferences -> Browse Packages, then open the User folder. From there, simply add the desired package.

# Auto Refresh Pattern
This package automatically refreshes files in the Sublime Text interface. It is useful when working with files used to redirect outputs or errors.
This package is inspired by the [original](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Auto%20Refresh) [AutoRefresh](https://github.com/Wouterdek/AutoRefresh) but know, you dont need to add manually list files in a settings file.
